the LAr.C script:
 can be used ....
 Formulas and numbers are based on the following article:
 "Index of refraction, Rayleigh scattering length, and Sellmeier coefficients
in solid and liquid argon and xenon"
 arXiv:1502.04213
 and private communication with one of the authors Emily Grace:
 emilygrace.k@gmail.com

 to run the script from the root command line do:
 root [0] .L LAr.C++
 root [1] init();                          initialize
 to make some plots do:
 root [2] sellmeierLAr();                 // plot refraction index between 110 and 700 nm
 root [3] sellmeierLAr(125.,130.);        // plot refraction index between 125 and 130 nm
 root [4] rayleigh();                     // plot rayleigh length between 110 and 400 nm
 root [5] rayleigh(125,130);              // plot rayleigh length between 110 and 400 nm

 to print out a table that can be cut and paste into the Geant4 gdml description:
 root [6] rindextable();                   // refraction index between 110 and 700 nm in nsteps=100 for T=83.81 K
 root [7] rindextable(200,300,10,3);       // refraction index between 200 and 300 nm in nsteps=10 for T=90 K
 root [8] rayleightable();                 // rayleigh length between 110 and 700 nm in nsteps=100 for T=83.81 K
 root [9] rayleightable(200,300,10,3);     // rayleigh length between 200 and 300 nm in nsteps=10 for T=90 K

The wls.C: script can be used to plot and fit the  quantum efficiency of TPB which is a wavelength shifter used in many
experiments based on liquid Argon TPCs. The value have been extracted from the following article: 

"Measurements of the intrinsic quantum efficiency and absorption
length of tetraphenyl butadiene thin films in the vacuum
ultraviolet regime"
Eur. Phys. J. C (2018) 78:329

 to run the script from the root command line do:
 
root [0] .L wls.C++
root [1] wls()
