# LArProperties
In Geant4 and Opticks optical properties like e.g. the materials refractive index are inputs that have to be provided. Here we collect the optical properties relevant for liquid Argon TPC's. In addition we provide scripts that put out this information in a form that can be used by Geant4/Opticks
